phd position antarctic ice shelf melt and hydrology,TU Delft,2020_07_17,https://www.indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=8fafc8ff52d1d419&fccid=43dfbb216f29aaed&vjs=3,"PhD Position Antarctic Ice Shelf Melt and Hydrology
As a PhD candidate you will study the surface melt and hydrology on Antarctic ice shelves to understand their role on ice shelf stability
Job description
Mass loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet is the largest uncertainty in current sea level rise projections and this uncertainty is largely related to the response of ice shelves. Ice shelves are the gatekeepers of Antarctica as they buttress the contribution of grounded ice to sea level rise. Although several processes have been identified that are key for future ice shelf instability and retreat, assessing how much, how fast ice shelf instability will contribute to future sea level rise remains a major uncertainty. This uncertainty is mainly the result of our limited quantitative understanding of many of the processes that control ice shelf instability. One of these processes is hydraulic fracturing as a result of ponding meltwater.
Surface meltwater and melt-albedo feedbacks at the surface of ice shelves are crucial drivers for ice shelf instability through hydrofracturing with important potential impacts as surface melt is projected to increase strongly in the coming century. However, to assess this impact we need improved models that better parameterize surface melt, the associated meltwater hydrology and their impact on hydrofracturing.
The objective of PhD project therefore is to develop and provide novel high-resolution remote sensing observations of surface conditions related to melt to better understand how, where, and how much surface meltwater is formed and where it goes. Within the project you will first combine various remote sensing data sets (optical, (in) SAR, scatterometers) related to melt, albedo and hydrology to get high-resolution estimates of melt and hydrology across all Antarctic ice shelves. Second, you will run offline models (snowmodels, surface energy models, hydrological models) to determine the relative importance of the atmospheric drivers (eg warming, changes in foehn / katabatic winds), hydrological conditions and the feedback processes (eg melt-albedo feedback ) on the satellite observed melt.
During your project, you will work in close collaboration with remote sensing and modeling experts at Delft University of Technology and the Institute for Marine and Atmospheric research Utrecht (IMAU). Your results will be used to validate and calibrate surface melt models over Antarctica and eventually improve our projections of future ice shelf stability.
This position is part of the HiRISE project, a collaboration between researchers at Utrecht University, Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands Royal Meteorological Institute (KNMI), Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ) and Université Libre de Bruxelles, and funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO). The project combines field measurements, satellite data and climate models to chart the current state of Antarctica's ice shelves with high resolution and accuracy and reduce the uncertainty in projections of sea level rise. The HiRISE team will eventually consist of four PhD candidates, four postdocs and one technician. During the project, you will spend part of your time at one of the collaborating institutes and actively exchange your results, ideas and plans during regular meetings with the other team members.
We aim to start the project on 1 Dec 2020. Your application should include a detailed CV, the abstract of your MSc thesis, at least two references, and a letter of motivation in a single PDF file.

phd position(s) wind turbine and wind farm control,TU Delft,2020_07_17,https://www.indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=9f3e80a334816529&fccid=43dfbb216f29aaed&vjs=3,"PhD Position (s) Wind Turbine and Wind Farm Control
As pioneers in the field of wind turbine and wind farm control, we are looking for ambitious PhD candidates to join our research group on these topics
Job description
Wind turbine control - While passive control (by mechanical design) has been the norm in wind turbine design in the past century, active control is becoming increasingly important in the current competitive market. If we compare the old stall-controlled wind turbines with today's modern individual-pitch-controlled turbines, we see that the load reductions these innovations brings about leads to a snowball effect in design efficiency, often translating in lighter and larger turbines. The next generation wind turbine controllers must be able to deal with the complex turbulent flows that a turbine experiences, they must deal with sensor faults, guarantee robustness under a variety of uncertainties, and in practice yield an economic lifetime of at least 20 years for offshore wind turbines with rotor diameters or over 150 meters. With the limited actuator bandwidth and strict constraints on component fatigue, this project focuses on the usage of (quasi) linear-parameter-varying model-predictive control for the next generation of wind turbines, assisted by lidar systems to measure the incoming turbulent wind.
Advanced wind farm control - Wind turbines packed in large offshore wind farms hinder each other by the formation of turbulent wind wakes, which lead to large efficiency losses at downstream turbines. A popular approach suggested in the literature to reduce these losses is by yawing the rotor several tens of degrees away from the incoming wind direction, thereby steering the wake away from the downstream turbine, at the cost of a small loss at the yawed turbine. However, the potency of this method strongly depends on the accuracy of the used wind farm model, which remains to be a large problem in the literature. This research project focuses on the robust controller synthesis for wake steering in modern offshore wind farms, as part of Prof. Van Wingerden's VIDI grant. A novel, integrated controller design will simultaneously optimize the wake steering strategy and the layout of the wind turbines in the farm, with real potential to reduce the cost of energy substantially. This work plays an important role in our society's renewable energy transition.

Ice shelves are the floating gatekeepers that surround 75% of Antarctica's coastline and buttress the contribution of grounded ice to sea level rise. Hence, ice shelf instability plays a key role in this uncertainty. The health of an ice shelves is, among other things, dependent on the firn layer on their surfaces, as this layer of compacted snow has the capacity to store meltwater. Once saturated, however, the remaining water will pool in surface features which may cause hydrofracturing and the eventual collapse of the entire ice shelf. A good understanding of subsurface processes in the firn layer, such as refreezing and meltwater retention, are therefore key to improving our understanding of current and future ice shelf stability. Unfortunately, field measurements of these processes are difficult to obtain due to the large extent and hazardous environment of Antarctica.
In this project, the successful applicant will combine various remote sensing data sets, such as backscatter and brightness temperature from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-3, CryoSat-2 and ASCAT, AMSR-E / AMSR2, to study changes in the firn layer. This will be compared to the output of a regional firn model, which you will couple to a snow microwave radiative transfer model to simulate the interaction of electromagnetic waves with the snowpack based on its physical properties. The multi-satellite set of observations and the a-prior knowledge of the microwave scattering sensitivity to snowpack properties from the coupled model will then be used to constrain the firn model in a Bayesian approach.
During your project, you will work in close collaboration with modeling experts at the Institute for Marine and Atmospheric research Utrecht (IMAU). It is expected that you will spend part of your time there. Your results will be used to validate and calibrate their model and eventually improve our projections of future ice shelf stability.
This position is part of the HiRISE project, a collaboration between researchers at Utrecht University, Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands Royal Meteorological Institute (KNMI), Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ) and Université Libre de Bruxelles, and funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO). The project combines field measurements, satellite data and climate models to chart the current state of Antarctica's ice shelves with high resolution and accuracy and reduce the uncertainty in projections of sea level rise. The HiRISE team will eventually consist of four PhD candidates, four postdocs and one technician. During the project, you will spend part of your time at one of the collaborating institutes and actively exchange your results, ideas and plans during regular meetings with the other team members.
Requirements
Required skills:
MSc in Remote Sensing, Geodesy, Aerospace Engineering, Geophysics, Glaciology, Geosciences or a related discipline;

Are you critical of how AI systems are developed and used today? And do you want to be a part of a team developing more responsible ways, centering safety and justice as the driving values? Read on!
Job description
This vacancy is part of the Hybrid Intelligence Center, a newly funded NWO Gravitation program, with the goal to study and develop approaches to Artificial Intelligence that put humans at the center, changing the course of the ongoing AI revolution.
The program will be recruiting 15 PhD or postdoc positions. For more information on the project, please take a look at www.hybrid-intelligence-centre.nl.
This PhD project starts from two central assumptions: Firstly, that all ""artificial intelligence systems” are hybrid, requiring the integration of human and machine activities. More fundamentally, AI systems are fundamentally sociotechnical, developed through myriad design tradeoffs and ""hard choices"" , and situated in a societal context where the system informs, influences or automates human decisions. And secondly, that AI systems contribute to ""programmable infrastructures"", meaning that these systems don't stand on themselves but are integrated into and restructure existing infrastructures and organizations, often with implications for democratic governance and sovereignty.
The PhD candidate will work in a growing team addressing issues of hard choices and programmable infrastructures, consisting of people with different disciplinary backgrounds. The position focuses on understanding how human factors are crucial for informing the design of AI systems in making sure these are safe in their behavior, just in their treatment of people, and allow affected stakeholders to be empowered to hold the system and its managers / operators / developers accountable.
The candidate will work to marry notions in traditional computer science and systems engineering with methods from situated design, participatory design, computational empowerment, action research and science-and-technology-studies, and other disciplines aiming to increase empowerment and participation in design. The project studies and facilitates the implementation of a data-driven, learning-based control scheme in the operation of electrical distribution networks, working closely together with Dutch utility companies and other societal stakeholders working on the transition to renewable energy resources. A second case study will be pursued in a more administrative context within the Digicampus (https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2019/tu-delft/digicampus-accelerates-innovation-in-digital-government-services/).
In these studies, the PhD candidate will work together with stakeholders from the different sectors to both study and inform system development. The aim is (1) to understand what human factors inform the development process of AI systems and how PD and other design methods can facilitate this, and (2) what human dimensions in the situated context need to be addressed to integrate and operate the AI system in a safe and just manner, seeking collaboration with appropriate fields of expertise. For both these contributions, the PhD candidate will be leaning on emerging literature to structure his / her investigations and seek advice and collaboration across the different disciplines within the department, the Hybrid Intelligence Center and internationally.
The selected candidate will also play a central role in building an international community of scholars advancing sociotechnical and situated studies of AI systems. This project will benefit from collaborations with dr. Seda Gürses in the Multi-Actor Systems department, and prof. Virginia Dignum and the Responsible AI group at Umeå University in Sweden.
Requirements
We seek a societally engaged engineer who loves to build things but is also intrinsically inclined to do so with a critical eye towards societal implications. Possible degree backgrounds are either a computer science field, an engineering field or a interdisciplinary field such as information systems or systems engineering and management, as long as you have a track record of building systems. You need to have experience with design in an engineering domain (electricity is great, but not necessary), and be versed in programming and data-driven methods (e.g. statistical learning, econometrics, artificial intelligence, control theory, optimization). Affinity with design methods, participatory methods or STS is a plus.
This position is a unique opportunity to develop yourself as an interdisciplinary scholar in the sociotechnical treatment of AI systems. It is not focused on building AI in theory, you will be going out in the world to build and study what is built, while engaging with domain experts, citizens, policymakers and other important stakeholders. You also need to have a drive and openness to work with other disciplines from social sciences and humanities. The department and mentorship provide a welcome, safe and fun place to do such bridge building work, while making sure you progress towards recognized contributions in this emerging field.
Conditions of employment
TU Delft offers PhD candidates a 4-year contract, with an official go / no go progress assessment after one year. Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labor Agreement for Dutch Universities, increasing from € 2395 per month in the first year to € 3061 in the fourth year. As a PhD candidate you will be enrolled in the TU Delft Graduate School.

post-doctoral position on structure-function analysis of nuclear receptor nur77/nr4a1 in cancer immunotherapy,Academisch Medisch Centrum,2020_07_17,https://www.indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=9082446c6b6d6f3c&fccid=280e9a541be45c33&vjs=3,"What you are going to do
We are seeking a highly driven Post-Doctoral researcher for a research project involving a public-private collaboration funded by Topconsortia for Knowledge and Innovation (TKI), within the department of Medical Biochemistry, Amsterdam UMC. Our ambition is to improve human immunotherapy. Recently, the nuclear receptor Nur77 / NR4A1 has been shown to modulate human cellular immunotherapy in cancer. * Cellular immunotherapy includes chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). CAR T cells are modified autologous T cells, whereas TILs are isolated from resected tumors and become expanded ex vivo. The aim of this fundamental project is to generate new insight into the exact mechanism of action of the transcription factor Nur77, and to identify inhibitory small-molecule compounds in collaboration with a company. You will integrate structural protein and functional activity data to define novel protein interfaces that allow modulation of Nur77 activity. The novel antagonists will be validated in human cell models that you will develop. High-end techniques including protein modeling, mutagenesis, multi-dimensional cytometry and imaging and dedicated cell culture models will be applied.
As a Post-Doctoral researcher you will also support and collaborate with PhD candidates, technicians and undergraduate students in the lab, participate in (inter) national meetings and publish in leading international journals.
Genome-wide analysis identifies NR4A1 as a key mediator of T cell dysfunction. Liu X, et al. Nature. 2019; 567: 525-529.
NR4A transcription factors limit CAR T cell function in solid tumors. Chen J, et al. Nature. 2019; 567: 530-534
What we expect from you
We are looking for a highly-motived candidate with a strong background in molecular and cellular biology, an interest in immunotherapy and the following expertise:
Obtained PhD in molecular biology or protein technology;
Extensive experience with molecular biological techniques and cell culture;
A good track record, inner drive and scientific curiosity;
While you work independently, you are also a valuable team member and have the social skills to collaborate with scientists from our institute and the biotech company;
You are enthusiastic, flexible and accurate in your work, and willing to join an interdisciplinary and international environment.
Where you are going to work
As Post-Doctoral researcher in this project you will join the research team of Carlie de Vries that is embedded in the department of Medical Biochemistry. Within the department 6 research groups work on subjects related to cardiovascular disease, metabolism and immunology with around 30 PhD candidates, 10 Post-Docs and 10 technicians. Working at Amsterdam UMC, location AMC means working in an inspiring and professional environment where personal development is encouraged. We offer you a unique public-private collaborative setting and a place to grow!
What we offer you
We offer you ample opportunity for development, deepening and broadening, additional training and a place to grow! Working at AMR means working in an inspiring and professional environment where development is encouraged in every respect.
The maximum gross monthly salary based on a 36-hour work week is € 4,615 (scale 10 CAO UMC), depending on qualifications and experience.
The base salary does not include holiday pay (8%) and a year-end bonus (8.3%).
We offer a contract for 12 months with the prospect of a 2.5-year extension.
In addition to excellent accessibility by public transport, AMC also has a sufficient number of parking spaces for employees.

system developer in question-based analysis of geographic information with semantic queries,Universiteit Utrecht,2020_07_17,https://www.indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=f67d7b86dc957a4f&fccid=1fef3c651d457079&vjs=3,"In the age of big data, geographic information has become a central means for data scientists of various disciplines to embed their analysis into a spatio-temporal context, from human mobility patterns and social inequality to the investigation of personal health. However, as the variety of data sources and software available on the web increases, it becomes more and more impossible to comprehend and utilize all geographic information system (GIS) tools and geodata available to answer geo-analytical questions. Hence, whenever a functionality is needed but not available in one tool, analysts are forced to reformulate their questions in terms of technicalities of another tool or other datasets. This procedure does not scale with the increasing variety of geo-analytic sources on the web, preventing analysts from tapping its full potential. It would mean a tremendous breakthrough if analysts could ask questions in order to get the tools and data required to answer them. Unfortunately, GIS technology currently cannot handle these questions.
In order to realize this vision, it is necessary to understand how geo-analytic resources on the web can be captured with the questions they answer. The QuAnGIS project is a 5-year research project which started in January 2019 and is funded by the European Research Commission (ERC). In the project, we are developing a novel approach to turn geo-analytical questions into machine-readable workflows using Semantic Web (RDF, OWL, SPARQL), Workflow synthesis (Semantic Linear-Time Logic), Natural Language Processing (syntactic parsing, parser generators), Question-Answering (QA), and other technologies. QuAnGIS is highly interdisciplinary at the intersection of Human Geography, GIScience, GIS, Information Science, Semantic Web, Computational Linguistics and Ontologies. It involves both empirical and computational studies as well as formal / ontological design studies.
In the project, we are developing both back-end and front-end technology. On the back-end, we are using a scalable document database (Mark Logic) that supports linked data and semantic queries. The database is used to store the semantic descriptions of geodata and GIS tool that can be queried by both front-end and back-end processes. Given a query from the front-end, the back-end processes are responsible for composing an answer workflow from the resources in the database. At the front-end, users can generate semantic queries with an AI-assisted web interface. The interface is based on a grammar to be developed in the project, and which also makes use of keywords for geodata search terms.
The candidate will assist the project team in overall design, development, testing, deployment, documentation, and maintenance of the front and back-ends of the QA system for the duration of the employment. In the near future, the candidate will focus on design and development of the back-end of the project, which is about workflow and geodata retrieval. The QA system should have a modular architecture consisting of largely self-contained software components. It should be possible to maintain and update each component independently of other components. Efficiency of the system is a major concern especially at the system's back-end. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the individual software components and the system as a whole are usable performance-wise. We prefer to use an incremental and iterative development process with frequent prototypes and proof-of-concepts that can be expanded into a complete component over time and / or used in scientific studies as necessary.
The system developer's activities involve (but are not limited to):
the setup of ETL procedures to load geodata and GIS tool descriptions (meta-data resources) as linked data into the system;
implement search indices and keyword search for linked data based meta-data resources;
implement a QuAnGIS workflow composition engine, based on existing workflow synthesis software developed at the Department of Information and Computing Sciences, parallel to the project, making use of meta-data resources and ontologies;
develop a corresponding workflow query engine which is used to fire workflow queries obtained from the front-end over possible workflows and data sources. Workflows are searched by semantic concepts, while data sources are searched in addition by keywords;
help set up a system to perform user studies for testing the tool / data repository with geo-spatial analysts;
support publication of results in scientific journals and in high-quality international conferences in these fields;
collaboration with outside investigators in joint studies.
Your responsibilities:
start with the project preferably in the second half of 2020 upon negotiations;
meet the goals / deadlines as set out in the project proposal;
thoroughly document software and hardware developments and monitor technical infrastructure;
participate in the research group's scientific activities.
The project team is part of a new Geographic Information Methods (GIM) interest group within the Social Urban Transitions (SUT) research program in the Department of Human Geography and Spatial Planning at the Faculty of Geosciences of Utrecht University. Currently, the core research team consists of the principal investigator (supervisor), a Postdoc, and two PhD students. The team works closely together with other Researchers, including those at the Department of Information and Computing Sciences at Utrecht University, as well as international partners like the University of Melbourne, UC Santa Barbara etc.
Profile We seek a highly motivated full-stack software developer who has a strong interest in designing data semantic systems in geographic analysis as well as GIS technology, with:
a MSc degree in Geographic Information Science, Computer Science, or Data Science;
affinity with scientific research especially in Geospatial Semantics, GIScience or Semantic Web / Ontology engineering and an interdisciplinary setting;
ability to quickly catch up with new concepts and ideas;
experience with setting up, using, and maintaining document retrieval databases and corresponding Semantic Web technology (NoSQL, SPARQL, document-based databases);
experience with web (geo-spatial) data sources and corresponding APIs, such as PDOK;
solid abilities in programming, application development and software engineering;
ability to write clean, well-documented, and reliable code (preferably in Python);
experience in web programming, web services, web APIs, or workflow synthesis algorithms is a bonus;
independent, pro-active working style;
motivation to work in an international team and with outside collaborators;
excellent scientific communication skills (written and verbally) in English.
offer
We offer a temporary position (1.0 FTE) for a period of two years. The gross salary - depending on previous qualifications and experience - ranges between € 2,790 and € 3,217 (scale 10 according to the Collective Labor Agreement Dutch Universities) per month for a full-time employment. Salaries are supplemented with a holiday bonus of 8% and a year-end bonus of 8.3% per year. In addition, Utrecht University offers excellent secondary conditions, including an attractive retirement scheme, (partly paid) parental leave and flexible employment conditions (multiple choice model).

postdoc researcher in renewable energy communities and power dynamics,TU Eindhoven,2020_07_17,https://www.indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=0c1a182d2c2e45a8&fccid=b357aa510b1bb882&vjs=3,"Job description
COME-RES project
The postdoc position will be part of the COME-RES project, a new Coordination and Support action funded by the EU H2020 program for 2,5 years (Sept. 2020 - Feb. 2023). COME-RES aims to facilitate the uptake of renewable energy sources in the electricity sector by supporting, with a set of specific activities, the implementation of the provisions for renewable energy communities (RECs) as defined in the new Renewable Energy Directive. Taking an interdisciplinary approach, COME-RES analyzes legal, socio-economic, spatial and environmental drivers potentially explaining the rate of deployment of RECs in selected target regions in nine European countries (Belgium, Germany, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland , Portugal, Spain). It covers different socio-technological systems including community PV, wind (onshore), storage and integrated solutions. Policy lessons with validity across Europe will be drawn and recommendations proposed. Over 85 stakeholders and market actors have provided letters of support expressing their commitment to support the project and implement its results.
The Postdoc position
We are looking for a candidate who is able to contribute to the implementation of the general managerial tasks of COME-RES in the Netherlands, as well as to develop a research project in support of the overall project goals.
The focus of the research project should be on the conceptual level of theorizing power dynamics in the interplay between renewable energy communities and the existing organization of the system of electricity provision. Particularly relevant here is the theory of ""governmentality"" (Foucault), an approach to social control that operates not through direct state sanction but through the indirect shaping of ""free"" social practices. The research should contribute to the careful analysis of the 'economies of power' involved in the various agendas for upscaling RECs as an integral component of the energy system of the future to understand in what sense the upscaling dynamic can be said to be 'empowering' .
A central managerial task is to set up stakeholder desks consisting of committed community, market and policy actors in the Netherlands. In collaboration with these stakeholder desks and the COME-RES consortium partners, specific tasks will be carried out such as i) analyzing the potentials, barriers and drivers for RECs in specific target regions, ii) organizing stakeholder dialogues, iii) developing regional action plans and business-model proposals for target regions, iv) examining good / best practice cases that are transferable to specific local, regional and national contexts, v) initiating transfers of best practice solutions via policy labs supported by capacity development and training and vi) developing a renewable energy community platform.
Job requirements
PhD in philosophy of technology or applied ethics; candidates with other relevant background (e.g. STS, transition studies, policy sciences) are also welcome to apply, provided their interests and abilities match the strong conceptual focus of the project.
Proven ability to conduct high-quality academic research, demonstrated by relevant publication (s).
Excellent mastering of Dutch and English language, good communication skills. Note that there is no Dutch language requirement.
Ability to work in a research team, in a dynamic, interdisciplinary context.
Proven ability in managerial tasks, especially involving non-academic stakeholders, is an advantage.
Conditions of employment
A meaningful job in a dynamic and ambitious university with the possibility to present your work at international conferences.
A 1.0 FTE employment for 2 to 2.5 years.
You will have free access to high-quality training programs for research and valorization, and didactical courses of the TEACH training program.
A gross monthly salary and benefits in accordance with the Collective Labor Agreement for Dutch Universities.
A broad package of fringe benefits (including an excellent technical infrastructure, moving expenses, and savings schemes).
Family-friendly initiatives are in place, such as an international spouse program, and excellent on-campus children day care and sports facilities.
Information and application
Application
Your application should contain the following documents:
a letter of application which explains your interest in the position and your qualifications for it;
a curriculum vitae;
a writing sample;
a one-page research proposal explaining how you want to develop the research on power dynamics (scope, topics, articles) and how you want to organize your managerial tasks to maximally support your theoretical and empirical research;
names and contact information of two persons willing to provide references.
If you are interested, we invite you to apply before August 15, 2020. Interviews will be held shortly thereafter. To apply please use the 'apply now' button. Please note that a maximum of 1 document can be uploaded, so if you have more than 1 document you will have to combine them. Please do not send us applications by e-mail.

Can you design and build a safe, infinitely scalable and welcoming landing zone? Join the new Cloud Engineering team!
Enjoy the challenge
You envision and flesh out our cloud solution. Depending on your interests, you zoom in mostly on architecture, security, ""hardcore"" development, design and / or automated testing
You claim end-to-end ownership over projects, in a setting where change is the only constant
You work in tandem with the team that manages VodafoneZiggo's on-premise data centers
You keep close tabs on the DevOps community, so solutions meet or exceed user expectations
You contribute to a landscape where cloud and on-premise solutions blend together as one: think ocean and sky as seen from a tropical island –hammock, palm trees and a chilled drink
This is what you'll do
As Cloud Engineer you lay the foundation for a public cloud environment that facilitates, empowers and inspires DevOps teams to maximize customer value. Each day.

Do it your way
And be an entrepreneur. All roads are open as Cloud Engineer at VodafoneZiggo. And where those roads lead? We honestly don't know yet, because we have only just embarked on our public cloud journey and it's up to you and your team to map the terrain. That requires a ""dare-devilish"" spirit because you sometimes have to make bold decisions without knowing all the facts. Let alone all possible outcomes. The role also calls for true craftsmanship. After all, you are the (wo) man with the plan, and colleagues look to you for guidance and inspiration. Speaking of colleagues: we stimulate autonomy but embrace cross-functional cooperation. If you're allergic to sharing, fuhgeddaboudit. ;-)

postdoc researcher digital twin development,Wageningen University & Research,2020_07_17,https://www.indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=831d1a8cfc63cb35&fccid=4be1581f8d3745b0&vjs=3,"Are you looking for a postdoc position in the field of agriculture and decision support tools focused on Digital Twin development to explore circular agricultural production systems?
The postdoc, a 3 year project, will develop a blueprint to represent digitally in real-time the main, waste and by-product streams between crops and livestock for optimal use of protein for feed and food. A better utilization of waste streams contributes to food security, resource conservation and adaptation to climate change. Digital twins are essentially models of individual objects or processes that are continuously fed by real-time information on the object or process and provide means for studying current and predicted behavior.
The goal of this postdoc project is to develop an integrated approach to optimize the use of waste streams, which are currently lost from the farm and regional system, for provision of protein for animal feed and human food, with a case study in the Nakuru region in Kenya. In the first phase an analysis of the prevailing farming system, including both crops and livestock, is done to arrive at an inventory of types and amounts of waste streams, where they occur and how they could be used (for example in biorefinery), with an eye on protein extraction potential. Different uses of crops, crop residues and other waste streams will be evaluated with a model-based scenario for the Nakuru region aiming at increasing food availability and sustainable food systems. In the second phase the foundation for a digital twin will be laid by identifying what models to combine to arrive at an overall model of food, feed and waste streams in a region or country, what data to measure / integrate to populate and interconnect these models and in what way the resulting digital twin could or should be used to guide decision making at various levels. The end result will be a blueprint for a digital twin in circular agricultural production systems, including a specification of requirements, an approach to development and a feasibility study.
The postdoc is part of the Digital Twins investment program at Wageningen University & Research in collaboration with the programs Connected Circularity and Protein Transition. The overarching research theme of this collaboration is agriculture innovation in developing countries. Key in the project is to have an integrated approach that ensures that decisions made locally, at an individual farm or location, contribute to finding an optimal solution at larger scales and vice versa, of regions or countries. The work will be carried out in Wageningen (at the Operations Research & Logistics group and at Plant Production Systems group and in Kenya at Egerton University (several months during the project period) in Nakuru, in collaboration with PhD students in the theme and in close consultation with the other researchers and supervisors in the project.

phd digital processing in ut-5g project,Universiteit Twente,2020_07_17,https://www.indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=8160d14a6f3713d6&fccid=2bcdad5fb10f2262&vjs=3,"The group of Radio Systems (RS) has a vacancy for a PhD student to work on the UT-5G Project.
About the project
To support the extreme growth of mobile traffic data, Giga-bit-per-second wireless communication links are required. There is consensus that these links will operate at millimeter wave frequencies. Anticipating on mainly Moore's law for IC technology evolution, these links would consume far too much power. This groundbreaking project focuses on the most power critical parts of a 5G base station (BS) system: the digital base band (BB) processor and the RF transmitters in a 5G BS. Power dissipation minimization for these two crucial blocks is vital to achieve an overall optimum.
Facing the abundant number of antennas within MIMO systems, power consumption of the BB processor becomes a bottleneck. Conventional digital signal processing is built upon the premises that digital hardware guarantees 100% correctness and signals are represented by a sufficiently many bits such that no distortion is introduced. Considerable power savings can be achieved if digital hardware is allowed to introduce small unnoticeable distortions while still guaranteeing the overall link quality. We plan research to get just enough precision (JEP) operations and representations, dependent on the number of users, aiming at massive 5G BS systems with a large antenna array (> 100 antennas).
Furthermore, within the analog part of transmitters, power amplification is increasingly inefficient. In this project, maximizing the efficiency of the RF transmitter in 5G base stations is the second research topic. In this, self-calibration and self-healing techniques wrapped around power optimized transmitters with digital predistortion will be developed, with an emphasis on system level performance and system level power efficiency, and by taking the massive-MIMO requirements into account from the earliest start .
The challenge
The tasks in this position are to
analysis (and possibly modify) algorithms for MIMO communication on the use of JEP operations and representations
develop, together with the UT-5G PhD. candidate on analog processing, digital predistortion, calibration and self-healing algorithms
investigate the implementation of algorithms for MIMO communication, digital predistortion, calibration and self-healing on standard IC technology.
Your profile
We look for a highly motivated, enthusiastic and curiosity-driven researcher.

phd position statistical integer linear programming in high dimensions,TU Delft,2020_07_17,https://www.indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=2635e562e5c06716&fccid=43dfbb216f29aaed&vjs=3,"PhD Position Statistical Integer Linear Programming in High Dimensions
Job description
This PhD position lies in the intersection of statistics (high-dimensional techniques) and optimization (integer linear programming) to handle the problems raised by big data. We are looking for a PhD candidate who can develop theoretical and practical tools for analyzing and solving complex large-scale optimization problems with data-driven constraints.
Many real-life optimization problems can be modeled and solved using integer linear programming (ILP). However, the input parameters needed for such an ILP are subject to uncertainty because of, for example, estimation errors or unexpected disturbance. In this project, the case is considered where the uncertain input data is high dimensional, which means that the number of available samples of our data is of the same order or even less than the dimension of the uncertain input parameter. For that reason, new statistical techniques need to be introduced for efficiently handling estimation errors in ILPs with high-dimensional input parameters that combine the theory of random matrices, modern shrinkage methods and machine learning.
The developed tools will be applied on problems arising in transportation. When solving flow-based routing problems, part of the input data is a time-varying origin-destination (OD) matrix, which gives the number of trips between each origin and destination. These matrices often include many OD pairs, but for each time step, only a limited number of observations is available. Therefore, the challenge in these routing problems is to design a robust network given the uncertain high dimensional OD matrices.
The PhD candidate will be jointly supervised by Dr. ir. Theresia van Essen (Optimization) and Dr. ir. Nestor Parolya (Statistics).
Department
Research at Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics (DIAM) is conducted in six research groups: Analysis, Applied Probability, Mathematical Physics, Numerical Analysis, Optimization, and Statistics.

Conditions of employment
This position combines a 6-year PhD project with teaching responsibilities and includes an official go / no go progress assessment after one year. In the first four years, the expected division between teaching and PhD research is 50/50; in the final two years the teaching load is reduced to 25%. This gives a total of 3.5 years of PhD research, and 2.5 of educational responsibilities.
The primary educational activities will be participating in teaching teams at the bachelor level, co-designing courses, providing lectures, recruiting and managing the teaching assistants, overseeing lab work, and creating and evaluating exercises. Lecturers are in close contact with students, monitor their progress, and pro-actively come up with course improvements. Furthermore, lecturers in a PhD track are involved in supervising bachelor and master students in their research thesis projects, as well as in co-teaching master courses in the area of ​​their research.
Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labor Agreement for Dutch Universities, increasing from € 2395 per month in the first year to € 3353 in the sixth year.

postdoc position: “satellite remote sensing of the footprint of wind farms in the north sea”,NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research,2020_07_17,https://www.indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=4044284d01bfffd4&fccid=ccaf93db39942b89&vjs=3,"The department of Estuarine & Delta Systems (EDS) of the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (Royal NIOZ) is looking for a highly motivated postdoctoral researcher with a PhD degree in earth observation, physical geography or civil engineering.
LOCATION: ROYAL NIOZ - LOCATION YERSEKE (ZEALAND)
VACANCY ID: 2020 - 36
CLOSING DATE: September 1st, 2020
The project
To reduce CO2 emissions, the Netherlands is committed to an energy transition from using fossil fuels to renewable energy. As part of this transition, offshore wind farms are being build and planned on a large scale in the North Sea. To enable good governance of offshore wind energy generation, balancing economical aspects and the marine environment in a sustainable way, the effects of wind farms on the physical and ecological processes in the North Sea need to be understood.
So far, the spatial ecological footprint of large-scale wind farms is poorly understood. This relates in particular to the role of turbine foundations on turbidity, with potential impact on the under-water light climate, nutrient availability and primary production, and hence on the entire food web, and on the role of turbine foundations in providing hard substrate for filter-feeding animals, with effects on nutrient cycling.
This project aims to provide insight in these effects at multiple spatial scales, using a combination of field observations, remote sensing applications and numerical hydrodynamics-ecosystem models, as to allow optimization of the implementation of wind farms from an ecological, economical and governance perspective. The postdoc position will focus on the use of satellite remote sensing in this context.
The vacancy
You will apply optical satellite remote sensing to elucidate the spatial footprint of large-scale wind farms, focusing on the effect of wind turbines on turbulence and wake formation and hence, turbidity and sediment dynamics. You will retrieve suspended sediment concentrations from long, harmonized, time-series or satellite data. You will use these spatiotemporal data to investigate how turbidity levels vary depending on the configuration of the wind turbines, and how these change with time after construction of wind farms, and analyze effects as a function of wind / wave and tidal conditions and mixing processes, as well as the characteristics of the substrate and water depth. The results will provide direct information for management and will also be used as a validation data set for the modeling study in this project.
The candidate
We are looking for a highly motivated candidate with a PhD degree in earth observation, physical geography or civil engineering. The candidate should have a good understanding of remote sensing, preferably with expertise in water quality. Experience with handling satellite data and programming is a prerequisite. Candidates should be capable of planning and organizing their own work independently, and meet deadlines imposed by the project.
The candidate should be open and communicative, and keen on interacting with project partners in frontier-applied research. Excellent communication skills and good English oral and writing skills are demanded, as the candidate must publish the findings in scientific journals and effectively communicate results to users.
The candidate will be positioned at NIOZ, and work in a research team that involves, among other partners, NIOZ, Deltares and WMR.
Conditions
Employment of this position at Royal NIOZ is by NWO (The Netherlands Organization of Scientific Research). We offer a position for a fixed-term period of 1 year (full-time). The salary is compliant to the CAO-OI (Collective Labor Agreement for Dutch Research Institutes), a pension scheme, a holiday allowance of 8% of the gross annual salary, a year-end bonus, and flexible work arrangements.
You may expect attractive secondary employment conditions. We offer generous relocation expenses for employees coming from abroad and support with finding accommodation.
The position will be based at the NIOZ-Yerseke, which is at commuting distance of cities like Antwerp, Breda, Middelburg and Vlissingen.
More information
For additional information about this vacancy, please contact Prof. dr. Daphne van der Wal, research leader. For additional information about the procedure, please contact Sigrid Moerbeek, sr. HRM advisor.

phd student rheology and structure development in polymer composites,TU Eindhoven,2020_07_17,https://www.indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=c4570ab5887ba983&fccid=b357aa510b1bb882&vjs=3,"Job description
A PhD position is available within the framework of the DPI (Dutch Polymer Institute) project ANGLE (Engineering the rheology and processing-induced structural anisotropy of polymer composites with non-Brownian fibrous particles). The PhD project will be a combined experimental-numerical study.
Reinforcing polymers with glass fibers is essential to reach strength and stiffness while maintaining light-weight. However, the improvement in ultimate properties is highly dependent on the microstructure of the fiber reinforcements and its anisotropy. This microstructure is developed during processing in the molten state and is governed by the interplay between flow and geometrical parameters, polymer rheology and particle characteristics. Despite the long-standing research interest in fiber-filled polymers, many open questions remain. The overall aim of this project is to develop a roadmap for controlling the microstructure and its orientation in composites consisting of viscoelastic polymers with anisotropic non-Brownian particles by engineering the formulation and processing conditions. An experimental-numerical approach will be used that takes advantage of various in-house developed experimental setups and numerical codes. For instance, we have recently developed a filament stretching rheometer wherein two pistons pull in opposite directions thereby allowing for the generation of a stagnation point extensional flow. This new type of rheometer allows to perform in-situ structure characterizations, e.g. crystallization studies via SAXS and WAXD. In the present project, the rheometer will be extended with light scattering possibilities to follow in-situ anisotropy development during processing. For the numerical modeling, an in-house developed finite element code will be used and adapted.
Research Group Polymer Technology
The PhD position is in the Polymer Technology group in the Mechanical Engineering department at Eindhoven University of Technology. The project will be supervised by Prof. Anderson, Dr. Ir. Cardinaels (experimental work) and Dr. Ir. Jaensson (numerical modeling).
During the project, there will be collaboration with several industrial partners from the DPI Consortium. Polymers are vital for energy, environment, and health. They are mainly characterized by their low density, ease of processing and shaping, possibilities of functional integration, and an almost unlimited flexibility in molecular design. Moreover, they are in most cases relatively cheap. These characteristics determine not only the societal needs for improved polymer systems in a multitude of application areas like protection, isolation, transportation, communication, illumination, packaging, shielding, housing, furniture, clothing etc., but also set the resulting scientific challenges. In the Polymer Technology group, our research is aimed at bridging the gap between science and technology in the area of ​​polymer processing and design, through the use of experimental and computational tools in the modeling of the full thermo-mechanical history of material (elements) during their formation, processing and final design, to quantitatively predict properties of processed objects. The research is aimed at bridging the gap between science and technology in the area of ​​polymer processing and design, through the use of experimental and computational tools in the modeling of the full thermo-mechanical history of material (elements) during their formation, processing and final design, to quantitatively predict properties of processed objects. Extensive state-of-the-art experimental facilities for the characterization of mechanical properties in the liquid (rheology) as well as solid (polymer testing) state, combined with microstructure characterization are available. Many of these devices are developed or modified in-house and are therefore unique.
An overview of the research performed in the Polymer Technology group can be found at:
http://www.tue.nl/universiteit/facultyen/werktuigbouwkunde/onderzoek/research-groups/polymer-technology/research/
Job requirements
We are looking for recently graduated, talented and enthusiastic candidates with excellent analytical skills, high grades and creative problem-solving skills. A MSc degree (or equivalent) in Mechanical Engineering, Materials Science, Physics or a related discipline is required, with experimental experience in materials characterization. Prior experience in experimental rheology, light scattering experiments, equipment construction or numerical simulations of viscoelastic fluid flows is a strong plus. Good English communication skills are required, both written and oral.
Conditions of employment
We offer:
A meaningful job in a dynamic and ambitious university with the possibility to present your work at international conferences.
A state-of-the-art experimental infrastructure and computational facilities
A full-time employment for four years, with an intermediate evaluation after one year.
To support you during your PhD and to prepare you for the rest of your career, you will have free access to a personal development program for PhD students (PROOF program).
As an excellent addition to your scientific education, PhD students in the Polymer Technology group get the opportunity to take part in the RPK program.
A gross monthly salary and benefits in accordance with the Collective Labor Agreement for Dutch Universities.
Additionally, an annual holiday allowance of 8% of the annual salary, plus a year-end allowance of 8.3% of the annual salary.

postdoc researcher humane use of human attention,TU Eindhoven,2020_07_17,https://www.indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=3d14dce8c0f1d0ea&fccid=b357aa510b1bb882&vjs=3,"Job description
Project on Humane Use of Human Attention
AI-based technologies (including “simple” apps) increasingly battle for human attention (Davenport & Beck, 2001) as they become the motor for optimizing marketing targets and customer behavior. These technologies manipulate (Fogg & Hreha, 2010; Fogg & Iizawa, 2008) user attention as the entry point for influencing human thinking, attitude formation and behavior. Counter-movements have analyzed the problematic and disruptive nature of this attention economy: loss of autonomy and increased addiction (Ertemel & Aydin, 2018), adverse effects on how our brain works (Carr, 2011) and even 'downgrading humanity' (Center for Human Technology, nd). However, these counter-movements struggle to formulate an alternative answer of ""human technology"". Very interestingly, some philosophies mention the practice of striving for attention as a solution to come to an anticipated human condition. Canonical Buddhist sources focus on concepts such as awareness and equanimity (e.g., Analayo, 2004; Goenka, 1999) and Western philosophy mentions concepts such as ataraxia (Epicurus) or authenticity (Sartre, 1983), to mention only a few.
The project aims to use this literature to critically reinterpret the current concepts of 'attention', 'autonomy' (Brown et al., 2015) and 'economy' (Brown, 2017) and will investigate whether these reinterpretations can support a normative foundation for human technology. The project (1 year, 50%) is exploratory in nature. The main tasks are to submit 1 article to a relevant journal and to submit an application for follow-up funding. Connections can be made with ongoing projects on customer behavior (i.e. scalings.eu) or the ethics of socially disruptive technologies (https://www.esdt.nl/).
Job requirements
PhD in Ethics, Philosophy, or a comparable domain.
Ability to conduct high quality academic research, demonstrated for instance by a relevant PhD thesis and / or publication (s).
Experienced in attention practices (vipassana, zen, or other). The challenge in this project will be to combine this personal experience with theoretical frameworks supplied by ethics / philosophy.
Contribute to the development of a research line on “attention” by building a network and submitting a research proposal for the period following this project.
Excellent mastering of the English language, good communication and leadership skills. Note that there is no Dutch language requirement.
Be a team player and able to work in a dynamic, interdisciplinary context.
Conditions of employment
A meaningful job in a dynamic and ambitious university with the possibility to present your work at international conferences.
A 0.5 or 0.6 FTE employment, with an end date of 31-07-2021.
You will have free access to high-quality training programs for research and valorization, and didactical courses of the TEACH training program.
A gross monthly salary and benefits in accordance with the Collective Labor Agreement for Dutch Universities.
A broad package of fringe benefits (including an excellent technical infrastructure, moving expenses, and savings schemes).
Family-friendly initiatives are in place, such as an international spouse program, and excellent on-campus children day care and sports facilities.
Information and application
Application
Your application should contain the following documents:
a letter of application which explains your interest in the position, your qualifications for it and your first ideas on the content and method of the research project;
a curriculum vitae illustrating both your philosophical expertise and your experiences with attention practices; and
a writing sample.
If you are interested, we invite you to apply before August 14, 2020. Interviews will be held shortly thereafter (week of August 24). To apply please use the 'apply now' button.

clinical phd candidate 'deep learning for prostate mri surveillance',Radboudumc,2020_07_17,https://www.indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=97eb3458208ea854&fccid=e8496aed9e5da069&vjs=3,"3 years The PhD candidate will work at DIAG and at MAGIC. DIAG currently has 50 deep learning researchers focused on various medical image analysis topics. The focus of DIAG is the development and validation of novel methods in a broad range of medical imaging applications. Research topics include image analysis, image segmentation, machine learning, and the design of decision support systems. Application areas include neuro, breast, prostate, lung and retina imaging and digital pathology. Key to the success of the group is close cooperation with clinicians. A team of scientific programmers is supporting our deep learning research, maintaining a large cluster of computers equipped with high-end GPUs for large-scale experimentation.
One million men receive a prostate cancer diagnosis, and three hundred thousand die from prostate cancer each year worldwide. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) represents a major breakthrough by accurately detecting clinically significant prostate cancers at an early, potentially more curable stage. The same MRI can also be used for better treatment targeting and for avoiding unnecessary systematic biopsies. As a result, the demand for Prostate MRI is rapidly increasing. Unfortunately, reading these multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) exams is difficult and requires substantial expertise. Computers can potentially extract more information from mpMRI, more reliably, and more accurately than human readers. Artificial Intelligence and more specifically Deep Learning is becoming indispensable in helping improve mpMRI diagnostic performance.
This EU funded project aims to research deep learning computer-aided diagnostic (DL-CAD) that will demonstrably help clinicians to get the best possible prostate cancer diagnosis from mpMRI. Radboudumc is a clinical expert on prostate MRI and technical expert in the field of prostate AI technology for over 20 years and an early adopter of deep learning in medical imaging. This project is a continuation of previous research in which CAD achieves expert performance in evaluating single time point mpMRI. In this project we will focus on surveillance mpMRI that has the potential to further reduce unnecessary biopsies and reduce over-treatment. For this project we are seeking a PhD candidate. The salary depends on education. Scale 10 will be offered to MSc medical graduates; those holding degrees in other disciplines will be offered scale 10A.
Upon commencement of employment we require a certificate of conduct (VOG) and there will be, depending on the type of job, a screening based on the provided cv. Radboud university medical center's HR Department will apply for this certificate on your behalf.
Read more about the Radboudumc employment conditions and what our International Office can do for you when moving to the Netherlands. The Minimally Invasive Image-Guided Intervention Center (MAGIC) has its roots in MRI-guided prostate treatment, and we have expanded to CT-, US-, and MR- image guided oncologic interventions, as for example biopsy of prostate, bone and liver ; (non-) thermal ablations of pancreas, liver, kidney, prostate and vascular malformations. Supplementary we focus on nuclear interventions with Holmium particles; intra-operative navigation; robotics; ex-vivo imaging; clinical decision support; and perfusion and vascular interventions. The interventions are developed and performed in close collaboration with the Medical Innovation and Technology expert Center (MITeC).

phd a data-driven approach for contactless sensing of viscoelastic materials,TU Eindhoven,2020_07_17,https://www.indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=3fbcc8cb3167903c&fccid=b357aa510b1bb882&vjs=3,"Job description
A PhD position is available within the framework of the interdisciplinary design projects of the Mechanical Engineering Department at Eindhoven University of Technology. The PhD project will be a combined experimental-numerical study.
Rheology is widely used to determine viscoelastic and flow properties of materials. Sophisticated rheometers have been developed that apply various model flows under well-controlled environmental conditions. The flow conditions are always chosen to obtain simplified stress-strain relations thereby allowing straightforward extraction of the material parameters. However, the experiments are generally extremely costly, require tedious sample handling protocols and operator training. Moreover, characterizing the complete material behavior over a wide range of flow types and intensities requires combining measurements from different devices. In essence, a rheological measurement is nothing more than “poking” the material somehow, thereby applying a stress or deformation and measuring the response (respectively deformation or stress). From the stress-strain relationship, material parameters can then be extracted. The more complex the flow field, the more difficult the inverse problem of extracting material parameters. Nevertheless, a more complex flow field means that intrinsically a much larger wealth of material information is present in the resulting signal. The challenge then becomes to convert this response to actual material parameters.
This design project aims at developing a contactless rheometer that provides flow and viscoelastic properties for materials with a wide spectrum of rheological behaviors. The proposed approach is based on the laser air-puff method, which was initially developed as a firmness test for fruits. In this method, an air puff is applied on the surface of a material and a laser sensor is used to measure the deformation of the surface at the center of the puff. From the extent of deformation, it can be determined whether the material is soft or stiff. In the proposed project, we would like to design a puff-rheometer, which advances the puff technique from a food-texture device to a true rheometer to characterize different rheological material parameters such as viscosity, moduli and yield stress. Thereto, novel image deformation characterization techniques will be coupled with a numerical framework for parameter extraction from viscoelastic fluid flow simulations. Such a contactless measurement that is robust and independent of operator handling as well as intelligent in choosing the deformation conditions has the potential to replace traditional rheometry in various industries or to be used as a non-destructive measurement for precious samples. Realizing this novel rheometer concept requires tackling challenges in different disciplines such as hardware design, image analysis and parameter estimation from viscoelastic flow simulations.
Research Group Polymer Technology
The PhD student will become a member of the Polymer Technology group in the Mechanical Engineering department at Eindhoven University of Technology. There will be co-supervision from and collaborations with the Control Systems Technology group and Power & Flow group, both in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Eindhoven University of Technology. In the Polymer Technology group, our research is aimed at bridging the gap between science and technology in the area of ​​materials processing and design, through the use of experimental and computational tools in the modeling of the full thermo-mechanical history of material (elements) during their formation, processing and final design, to quantitatively predict properties of processed objects. Extensive state-of-the-art experimental facilities for the characterization of mechanical properties in the liquid (rheology) as well as solid (polymer testing) state, combined with microstructure characterization are available. Many of these devices are developed or modified in-house and are therefore unique. The numerical simulation code for viscoelastic fluid flow simulations is in-house developed as well. The group employs a full-time technical staff member with ample experience in equipment design and development.

phd privacy-preserving fault detection in cyber-physical systems,TU Eindhoven,2020_07_17,https://www.indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=6a0e792cfd3c6b29&fccid=b357aa510b1bb882&vjs=3,"Job description
The Dynamics and Control (D&C) group at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU / e) is looking for a talented PhD candidate to work on developing analysis and synthesis tools for privacy-preserving fault detection schemes for networked Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS).
Technology companies today manufacture and sell high-tech equipment capable of measuring, processing, and transmitting operational data in real-time over the cloud. Companies collect data of the day-to-day operation of equipment to monitor the life and proper operation of their products. Online equipment monitoring allows them to forecast failures and schedule maintenance before a critical fault (event) occurs. However, sharing operational data might not be attractive to end-users as private / sensitive information of the products (services) they manufacture (provide) could be disclosed. There are two potential privacy threats in this setting: 1) the customer does not wish the manufacturer (service provider) to infer certain information (e.g., manufactured products specs); and 2) it is the communication channel itself (e.g., the internet), what the customer does not trust. Conversely, online equipment monitoring extends the life of equipment, decreases production bottlenecks, and prevents high and unexpected costs. That is, we have two opposite aspects here, customers would like to share data to improve performance but they do not want to share it for privacy reasons. It is therefore attractive for both parties (customers and manufacturers) to have masking mechanisms that allow for: 1) coding operational data before disclosure so that private information is hidden (in some appropriate sense); and 2) the coded data to be used by the manufacturer (service provider) to detect faults and schedule maintenance.
The broad goal of this project is to develop fundamental systems, control, and information theoretic tools that allow constructing privacy-preserving fault detection schemes for networked Cyber-Physical Systems. We aim at synthesizing real-time fault detection algorithms that, on the one hand, satisfy the required prescribed detection performance; and, on the other hand, guarantee a private exchange of system data over (potentially untrusty) communication networks. The main research questions to be addressed in the project are: Depending on the class of systems under study (eg, linear, nonlinear, stochastic, hybrid, etc.), how to properly select privacy metrics that make sense from the point of view of dynamical systems? Given a particular privacy metric and a fault detection scheme, how to quantify the privacy level (information leakage) provided by the detection scheme? And, what synthesis tools can be used to systematically design coding functions and fault detection algorithms to maximize privacy and guarantee prescribed detection performance?
The Dynamics and Control (D&C) group at TU / e trains the next-generation of students to understand and predict the dynamics of complex engineering systems in order to develop advanced control, estimation, planning, and learning strategies which are at the core of the intelligent autonomous systems of the future. Autonomous vehicles, fully automated industrial value chains, high-tech systems, collaborative robots in unstructured environments, intelligent medical devices, automated transportation networks, soft robotics, together with sustainable automotive technology are key examples of the broad application domain of the (D&C) group . The design of these systems requires a thorough understanding of their underlying dynamics. Therefore, the first focal point of our research is on both data-based and first-principles-based modeling, model complexity management, and dynamic analysis of complex, multi-physics and multi-disciplinary engineering systems. Building on this foundation, our second focal point is on “making autonomous systems smarter”. To this end, we develop both model- and data-based sensing, planning, and learning and control technologies to provide autonomous systems with the intelligence needed to guarantee performance, robustness, and safety. Combining the investigation on both dynamics and control theory in one section allows to take on these challenges standing in a privileged position. In particular, it enables us to educate uniquely skilled engineers and researchers as well as to valorize our research together with the high-tech, automotive and energy sectors.

LOCATION: ROYAL NIOZ - LOCATION YERSEKE (ZEALAND)
VACANCY ID: 2020 - 36
CLOSING DATE: September 1st, 2020
The project
To reduce CO2 emissions, the Netherlands is committed to an energy transition from using fossil fuels to renewable energy. As part of this transition, offshore wind farms are being build and planned on a large scale in the North Sea. To enable good governance of offshore wind energy generation, balancing economical aspects and the marine environment in a sustainable way, the effects of wind farms on the physical and ecological processes in the North Sea need to be understood.
So far, the spatial ecological footprint of large-scale wind farms is poorly understood. This relates in particular to the role of turbine foundations on turbidity, with potential impact on the under-water light climate, nutrient availability and primary production, and hence on the entire food web, and on the role of turbine foundations in providing hard substrate for filter-feeding animals, with effects on nutrient cycling.
This project aims to provide insight in these effects at multiple spatial scales, using a combination of field observations, remote sensing applications and numerical hydrodynamics-ecosystem models, as to allow optimization of the implementation of wind farms from an ecological, economical and governance perspective. The postdoc position will focus on the use of satellite remote sensing in this context.
The vacancy
You will apply optical satellite remote sensing to elucidate the spatial footprint of large-scale wind farms, focusing on the effect of wind turbines on turbulence and wake formation and hence, turbidity and sediment dynamics. You will retrieve suspended sediment concentrations from long, harmonized, time-series or satellite data. You will use these spatiotemporal data to investigate how turbidity levels vary depending on the configuration of the wind turbines, and how these change with time after construction of wind farms, and analyze effects as a function of wind / wave and tidal conditions and mixing processes, as well as the characteristics of the substrate and water depth. The results will provide direct information for management and will also be used as a validation data set for the modeling study in this project.
The candidate
We are looking for a highly motivated candidate with a PhD degree in earth observation, physical geography or civil engineering. The candidate should have a good understanding of remote sensing, preferably with expertise in water quality. Experience with handling satellite data and programming is a prerequisite. Candidates should be capable of planning and organizing their own work independently, and meet deadlines imposed by the project.
The candidate should be open and communicative, and keen on interacting with project partners in frontier-applied research. Excellent communication skills and good English oral and writing skills are demanded, as the candidate must publish the findings in scientific journals and effectively communicate results to users.
The candidate will be positioned at NIOZ, and work in a research team that involves, among other partners, NIOZ, Deltares and WMR.
Conditions
Employment of this position at Royal NIOZ is by NWO (The Netherlands Organization of Scientific Research). We offer a position for a fixed-term period of 1 year (full-time). The salary is compliant to the CAO-OI (Collective Labor Agreement for Dutch Research Institutes), a pension scheme, a holiday allowance of 8% of the gross annual salary, a year-end bonus, and flexible work arrangements.
You may expect attractive secondary employment conditions. We offer generous relocation expenses for employees coming from abroad and support with finding accommodation.
The position will be based at the NIOZ-Yerseke, which is at commuting distance of cities like Antwerp, Breda, Middelburg and Vlissingen.
More information
For additional information about this vacancy, please contact Prof. dr. Daphne van der Wal, research leader. For additional information about the procedure, please contact Sigrid Moerbeek, sr. HRM advisor.
Please visit the Department of Estuarine & Delta Systems (EDS) here.
Job interviews are foreseen for September 2020, in Yerseke or online. The starting date for this position is ± December 1st 2020.

In fact, you are the basis of installations for various companies. You design, develop and implement embedded software, resulting in optimal processes. How do you do it? We would like to hear from you; apply today!
About this function
The results of your work are very visible to our clients in the Groningen region: (industrial) installations do not work automatically; they run on PLC or SCADA. And you have been involved in the development of this software. We don't really need to tell you how this works, because you know how to translate a customer question into a design. For this you spar together with Mechanical Engineers, Hardware Engineers and other Software Engineers, after which you develop both a functional and technical setup. Then you check all definitions, and after completing the design phase, the FAT (Factory Acceptance Test) and SAT (Site Acceptance Test) are performed: time for commissioning!
About you
As a Software Engineer you are the link between IT and Engineering. So it is useful if you have affinity with both sectors, and even better if you have experience with both. In any case, your HBO diploma in Industrial Automation, Mechatronics, Electrical Engineering or (Technical) Computer Science gives you a good foundation - that diploma says a lot about your knowledge and technical insight.
You do not have any problems with taking responsibility. In fact, it even makes you feel good. As a Software Engineer you get motivated by challenge in different areas - and a bit of complexity - in your work!
What we offer
Are you making the move to Brunel? Then you take the step to progress. Being seconded as a Software Engineer to our clients means: gaining experience at several companies, while you have the certainty of a contract with Brunel. We also offer you:
A nice base salary with on top of that several bonus opportunities
The opportunity to obtain relevant certificates at Brunel's expense
Guidance during every project by a permanent Brunel consultant
Access to all kinds of exclusive events and (network) drinks
About us
The Software Engineer profession is a separate subject. After all, every client requires specialist knowledge and expertise. How do you find a place where you can practice your profession well, a place where you find a challenge and you feel at home? That too is a profession in itself. At Brunel, we therefore focus 100% on connecting. Connect companies to Brunellers, and vice versa. We have now built up a huge portfolio of companies in various sectors, and our network also consists of a large group of enthusiastic specialists. And to keep it that way, we at Brunel are only satisfied with a golden match. A match that every involved party wouldn't want to miss! Also go for your golden match? Apply today.

A democracy has a transparent government. The government will only keep certain information to itself if there is no other option. In order to steer this transparency, the rules regarding public access have been included as much as possible in the Wob (Public Access to Government Act). Citizens can request information that the government does not publish on its own via a Wob procedure. You decide whether he will receive this information. Thanks to your up-to-date knowledge of the laws and regulations, you know exactly which information belongs legally in public and which does not.

Of course you are specialized in the rules regarding public access. But we ask for more. Our ideal Jurist Wob also has ...

About this function
You get the most diverse legal issues on your plate every day. No problem, after all, you are an expert in legal matters for a reason. Moreover, you find it refreshing, that variety of topics you cover.

With the certainty of a permanent contract, you can work with us to see which project suits you. Once you have started working, you can fall back on a coach at Brunel who knows about legal matters and is always there for you.
About you
Our clients must be able to build on your expertise, so demonstrable knowledge of legal matters is absolutely essential. That is why it is important that you have completed a university education in Dutch law, with a Master's degree in Business Law, for example.

Pragmatic insight and a lot of persuasion
What we offer
As Legal Counsel you are one of the few with our partners who really understands legal matters. It may therefore just happen that you have to explain some things from time to time. Presenting a good course comes in handy! Because you join us, you can always participate in courses, training and workshops that make you better in your field. We even plan a complete training program together with you. We offer you even more:
A good salary based on your experience and knowledge
Substantial bonus opportunities Guidance with every project

Graduate decision making
How does decision-making take place within public organizations, and how can this be taken into account in projects? Witteveen + Bos is busy with that question, and we are happy to call in the help of a master's student for this. Are you interested in government decision-making and projects related to dyke improvements, energy transition or infrastructure? Do you know the theory of decision-making processes and structures, but are you curious how this works in practice? Then this graduation assignment might be something for you!
As an engineering firm, we strengthen dikes, widen roads and rivers or work on sustainable energy, usually on behalf of a government organization. This can be a province, water board or municipality, but also Rijkswaterstaat, an environmental department or Staatsbosbeheer. Within these types of projects, decisions are constantly taken by our client and his director, who determines the direction of the projects, but also progress. It is important for us to have control and control over this decision-making, so that we can adjust the content of our work and our planning accordingly. If a decision is delayed, or if it turns out to be very different in content than we expected, the project must be adjusted and we run the risk of delay. But how do you get a better grip on that decision-making? And how can we provide directors with the right information to make decisions. We hope to find an answer with you!
Research assignment
The issue we are interested in is decision-making within public organizations, especially governments. Decision-making ranges from small daily decisions to far-reaching multi-year decisions; these can be commercial, but also formal legal decisions. For example, the adoption of a plan product such as a preferred alternative bill by the Daily Board of a Water Board, versus the approval of a presentation for a residents' meeting. In addition, formal and informal dynamics play a role in decision-making: official mandates and processes, but also political dynamics and social relations between actors or organizations.
We would like your research to cover the following:
sharpening the learning question within Witteveen + Bos regarding decision-making. What exactly do we mean by decision-making, and why do we want to get a better grip on it? For this you can conduct interviews with project leaders of Witteveen + Bos;
giving an initial answer to that learning question based on literature;
exploring opportunities to gain more control over decision-making, as well as its added value;
elaborating those options into concrete recommendations and, if possible, methods to apply this in practice.
This research assignment can, of course, be adapted to your research interests or scientific frameworks.
What we ask
We are looking for a master student who wants to write a thesis or thesis with us, of at least 30 ECTS. Knowledge of decision-making, governance, public administration and public organizations is required, gained in studies such as Technical Public Administration, Sustainable Development, Governance and Policy, Engineering and Policy Analysis, or Public Administration.
What we offer
As a graduate with us you work under good supervision on an issue that is both scientifically and socially relevant. We continuously have about 40 students who graduate with us. As a graduate you are part of a group and you have a permanent supervisor. We will determine the design of your graduation assignment together, with the frameworks indicated above. We think it is important that the assignment fits seamlessly with your interests and of course also that it meets the requirements of your study.
If your graduation assignment is of value to our organization, you will receive a graduation fee from us. If you incur travel expenses, we will reimburse you for this. And, if your graduation period was successful, there are also plenty of opportunities for a career within our organization afterwards!
Who we are
Witteveen + Bos is a consultancy and engineering agency that provides solutions worldwide for complex, technical and social issues in the field of water, infrastructure, environment and construction. From an inspiring working environment, our more than 1,000 employees work in multidisciplinary project teams on fascinating projects at home and abroad.

phd position antarctic ice shelf melt and hydrology,TU Delft,2020_07_18,https://www.indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=8fafc8ff52d1d419&fccid=43dfbb216f29aaed&vjs=3,"PhD Position Antarctic Ice Shelf Melt and Hydrology
As a PhD candidate you will study the surface melt and hydrology on Antarctic ice shelves to understand their role on ice shelf stability
Job description
Mass loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet is the largest uncertainty in current sea level rise projections and this uncertainty is largely related to the response of ice shelves. Ice shelves are the gatekeepers of Antarctica as they buttress the contribution of grounded ice to sea level rise. Although several processes have been identified that are key for future ice shelf instability and retreat, assessing how much, how fast ice shelf instability will contribute to future sea level rise remains a major uncertainty. This uncertainty is mainly the result of our limited quantitative understanding of many of the processes that control ice shelf instability. One of these processes is hydraulic fracturing as a result of ponding meltwater.
Surface meltwater and melt-albedo feedbacks at the surface of ice shelves are crucial drivers for ice shelf instability through hydrofracturing with important potential impacts as surface melt is projected to increase strongly in the coming century. However, to assess this impact we need improved models that better parameterize surface melt, the associated meltwater hydrology and their impact on hydrofracturing.
The objective of PhD project therefore is to develop and provide novel high-resolution remote sensing observations of surface conditions related to melt to better understand how, where, and how much surface meltwater is formed and where it goes. Within the project you will first combine various remote sensing data sets (optical, (in) SAR, scatterometers) related to melt, albedo and hydrology to get high-resolution estimates of melt and hydrology across all Antarctic ice shelves. Second, you will run offline models (snowmodels, surface energy models, hydrological models) to determine the relative importance of the atmospheric drivers (eg warming, changes in foehn / katabatic winds), hydrological conditions and the feedback processes (eg melt-albedo feedback ) on the satellite observed melt.
During your project, you will work in close collaboration with remote sensing and modeling experts at Delft University of Technology and the Institute for Marine and Atmospheric research Utrecht (IMAU). Your results will be used to validate and calibrate surface melt models over Antarctica and eventually improve our projections of future ice shelf stability.
This position is part of the HiRISE project, a collaboration between researchers at Utrecht University, Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands Royal Meteorological Institute (KNMI), Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ) and Université Libre de Bruxelles, and funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO). The project combines field measurements, satellite data and climate models to chart the current state of Antarctica's ice shelves with high resolution and accuracy and reduce the uncertainty in projections of sea level rise. The HiRISE team will eventually consist of four PhD candidates, four postdocs and one technician. During the project, you will spend part of your time at one of the collaborating institutes and actively exchange your results, ideas and plans during regular meetings with the other team members.
We aim to start the project on 1 Dec 2020. Your application should include a detailed CV, the abstract of your MSc thesis, at least two references, and a letter of motivation in a single PDF file.
Requirements
Required skills:
MSc in Remote Sensing, Geosciences, Aerospace Engineering, Geophysics, Glaciology, Hydrology or a related discipline;

phd position(s) wind turbine and wind farm control,TU Delft,2020_07_18,https://www.indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=9f3e80a334816529&fccid=43dfbb216f29aaed&vjs=3,"PhD Position (s) Wind Turbine and Wind Farm Control
As pioneers in the field of wind turbine and wind farm control, we are looking for ambitious PhD candidates to join our research group on these topics
Job description
Wind turbine control - While passive control (by mechanical design) has been the norm in wind turbine design in the past century, active control is becoming increasingly important in the current competitive market. If we compare the old stall-controlled wind turbines with today's modern individual-pitch-controlled turbines, we see that the load reductions these innovations brings about leads to a snowball effect in design efficiency, often translating in lighter and larger turbines. The next generation wind turbine controllers must be able to deal with the complex turbulent flows that a turbine experiences, they must deal with sensor faults, guarantee robustness under a variety of uncertainties, and in practice yield an economic lifetime of at least 20 years for offshore wind turbines with rotor diameters or over 150 meters. With the limited actuator bandwidth and strict constraints on component fatigue, this project focuses on the usage of (quasi) linear-parameter-varying model-predictive control for the next generation of wind turbines, assisted by lidar systems to measure the incoming turbulent wind.
Advanced wind farm control - Wind turbines packed in large offshore wind farms hinder each other by the formation of turbulent wind wakes, which lead to large efficiency losses at downstream turbines. A popular approach suggested in the literature to reduce these losses is by yawing the rotor several tens of degrees away from the incoming wind direction, thereby steering the wake away from the downstream turbine, at the cost of a small loss at the yawed turbine. However, the potency of this method strongly depends on the accuracy of the used wind farm model, which remains to be a large problem in the literature. This research project focuses on the robust controller synthesis for wake steering in modern offshore wind farms, as part of Prof. Van Wingerden's VIDI grant. A novel, integrated controller design will simultaneously optimize the wake steering strategy and the layout of the wind turbines in the farm, with real potential to reduce the cost of energy substantially. This work plays an important role in our society's renewable energy transition.

phd position remote sensing of ice shelf firn processes,TU Delft,2020_07_18,https://www.indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=34708d3d3b035cea&fccid=43dfbb216f29aaed&vjs=3,"PhD Position Remote Sensing of Ice Shelf Firn Processes
As a PhD candidate you will study the changes in the firn layer on Antarctic ice shelves by combining various remote sensing data sets with firn models
Job description
Antarctic mass loss is the largest source of uncertainty in current sea level rise projections. Ice shelves are the floating gatekeepers that surround 75% of Antarctica's coastline and buttress the contribution of grounded ice to sea level rise. Hence, ice shelf instability plays a key role in this uncertainty. The health of an ice shelves is, among other things, dependent on the firn layer on their surfaces, as this layer of compacted snow has the capacity to store meltwater. Once saturated, however, the remaining water will pool in surface features which may cause hydrofracturing and the eventual collapse of the entire ice shelf. A good understanding of subsurface processes in the firn layer, such as refreezing and meltwater retention, are therefore key to improving our understanding of current and future ice shelf stability. Unfortunately, field measurements of these processes are difficult to obtain due to the large extent and hazardous environment of Antarctica.
In this project, the successful applicant will combine various remote sensing data sets, such as backscatter and brightness temperature from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-3, CryoSat-2 and ASCAT, AMSR-E / AMSR2, to study changes in the firn layer. This will be compared to the output of a regional firn model, which you will couple to a snow microwave radiative transfer model to simulate the interaction of electromagnetic waves with the snowpack based on its physical properties. The multi-satellite set of observations and the a-prior knowledge of the microwave scattering sensitivity to snowpack properties from the coupled model will then be used to constrain the firn model in a Bayesian approach.
During your project, you will work in close collaboration with modeling experts at the Institute for Marine and Atmospheric research Utrecht (IMAU). It is expected that you will spend part of your time there. Your results will be used to validate and calibrate their model and eventually improve our projections of future ice shelf stability.
This position is part of the HiRISE project, a collaboration between researchers at Utrecht University, Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands Royal Meteorological Institute (KNMI), Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ) and Université Libre de Bruxelles, and funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO). The project combines field measurements, satellite data and climate models to chart the current state of Antarctica's ice shelves with high resolution and accuracy and reduce the uncertainty in projections of sea level rise. The HiRISE team will eventually consist of four PhD candidates, four postdocs and one technician. During the project, you will spend part of your time at one of the collaborating institutes and actively exchange your results, ideas and plans during regular meetings with the other team members.

Are you critical of how AI systems are developed and used today? And do you want to be a part of a team developing more responsible ways, centering safety and justice as the driving values? Read on!
Job description
This vacancy is part of the Hybrid Intelligence Center, a newly funded NWO Gravitation program, with the goal to study and develop approaches to Artificial Intelligence that put humans at the center, changing the course of the ongoing AI revolution.
The program will be recruiting 15 PhD or postdoc positions. For more information on the project, please take a look at www.hybrid-intelligence-centre.nl.
This PhD project starts from two central assumptions: Firstly, that all ""artificial intelligence systems” are hybrid, requiring the integration of human and machine activities. More fundamentally, AI systems are fundamentally sociotechnical, developed through myriad design tradeoffs and ""hard choices"" , and situated in a societal context where the system informs, influences or automates human decisions. And secondly, that AI systems contribute to ""programmable infrastructures"", meaning that these systems don't stand on themselves but are integrated into and restructure existing infrastructures and organizations, often with implications for democratic governance and sovereignty.
The PhD candidate will work in a growing team addressing issues of hard choices and programmable infrastructures, consisting of people with different disciplinary backgrounds. The position focuses on understanding how human factors are crucial for informing the design of AI systems in making sure these are safe in their behavior, just in their treatment of people, and allow affected stakeholders to be empowered to hold the system and its managers / operators / developers accountable.
The candidate will work to marry notions in traditional computer science and systems engineering with methods from situated design, participatory design, computational empowerment, action research and science-and-technology-studies, and other disciplines aiming to increase empowerment and participation in design. The project studies and facilitates the implementation of a data-driven, learning-based control scheme in the operation of electrical distribution networks, working closely together with Dutch utility companies and other societal stakeholders working on the transition to renewable energy resources. A second case study will be pursued in a more administrative context within the Digicampus (https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2019/tu-delft/digicampus-accelerates-innovation-in-digital-government-services/).
In these studies, the PhD candidate will work together with stakeholders from the different sectors to both study and inform system development. The aim is (1) to understand what human factors inform the development process of AI systems and how PD and other design methods can facilitate this, and (2) what human dimensions in the situated context need to be addressed to integrate and operate the AI system in a safe and just manner, seeking collaboration with appropriate fields of expertise. For both these contributions, the PhD candidate will be leaning on emerging literature to structure his / her investigations and seek advice and collaboration across the different disciplines within the department, the Hybrid Intelligence Center and internationally.
The selected candidate will also play a central role in building an international community of scholars advancing sociotechnical and situated studies of AI systems. This project will benefit from collaborations with dr. Seda Gürses in the Multi-Actor Systems department, and prof. Virginia Dignum and the Responsible AI group at Umeå University in Sweden.
Requirements
We seek a societally engaged engineer who loves to build things but is also intrinsically inclined to do so with a critical eye towards societal implications. Possible degree backgrounds are either a computer science field, an engineering field or a interdisciplinary field such as information systems or systems engineering and management, as long as you have a track record of building systems. You need to have experience with design in an engineering domain (electricity is great, but not necessary), and be versed in programming and data-driven methods (e.g. statistical learning, econometrics, artificial intelligence, control theory, optimization). Affinity with design methods, participatory methods or STS is a plus.

You don't have to prove yourself anymore. In fact, you sometimes have to slow down to make sure the rest can keep up. But that may end once. You prefer people around you who know how to challenge you. Colleagues you can learn from and problems you haven't solved before. This is your chance.
Sounds nice, but what are you talking about?
There are a lot of consultancy agencies in the Netherlands, but very few that are able to grow even in these weird times. This is one of them. And not without reason. They only work with the best people on the coolest projects.
Now you will think, I've heard that before. Only this time it is really true. It starts with the requirements they place on their consultants. Everyone has a Master. And it is not just about knowledge, but also about the soft skills required to apply that knowledge. The business insight, communication skills and political sensitivity that you need to inform, convince and enthuse others. Their consultants are therefore real talents and one by one, impressive professionals.
In addition, they are not only demanding towards their own employees, but also towards their customers. From the largest banks and insurers, to construction companies and energy companies. Large companies with even greater challenges. If it is not incredibly complex and almost impossible, then they do not.
Interesting, but what do you need from me then?
Within the projects that this company carries out for its customers, there is always a challenge for a skilled software engineer. A Full Stack .NET Developer who feels completely at home in .NET Core and for whom frameworks such as React and Angular have no secrets. Someone who has already forgotten more about software development than most people know. Somebody like you.
I am, but I don't work for free
Fortunately, you are not only challenged every day at this company, you are also well rewarded. In addition to an annual salary of up to € 65,000 gross, you also receive attractive fringe benefits, including a non-contributory pension and a lease car. Plus, you can be sure to only collaborate with the best in their field, from Data Scientists and Developers, to UX Researchers. Ready for the next challenge?
